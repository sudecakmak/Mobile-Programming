# Mobile-Programming
Projects I made in mobile programming. I use android studio for my projects.

## Calculator App
It displays the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers written by the user in the textbox.

## Radiobutton App
The picture of the selected animal is displayed in the imagebox. The animal image comes from the link address of the photo with the internet connection setup using the gidle library.

## Checkbox App
Selected days are shown in texbox, if the day is deselected the day written in texbox will be removed.

## Login App

## Seekbar App
The seekbar on the screen determines the range of red, blue and green colors and allows the background color to change according to the seekbar movement.

## SharedPreferences
Adding a shared preference to the seekbar application. The red, green, blue values are saved and when the app is opened again, thanks to the last saved color values the background color are displayed.


## Listview App
The provinces of the region selected from the spinner are shown in the listview.
